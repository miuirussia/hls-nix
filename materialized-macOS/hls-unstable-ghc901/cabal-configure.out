characteristics that caused the previous version to fail: excludes 'ghc'
version 9.0.1)
[__5] fail (backjumping, conflict set: ghc, ghcide, hie-bios)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: ghc, ghcide, hie-bios, base,
ghc-api-compat, czipwith
Try running with --minimize-conflict-set to improve the error message.
