Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: ghc-api-compat-8.6.1 (user goal)
[__1] trying: base-4.15.0.0/installed-4.15.0.0 (dependency of ghc-api-compat)
[__2] trying: ghcide-1.4.0.2 (user goal)
[__3] next goal: lsp-types (dependency of ghcide)
[__3] rejecting: lsp-types-1.2.0.0 (conflict:
base==4.15.0.0/installed-4.15.0.0, lsp-types => base>=4.11 && <4.15)
[__3] skipping: lsp-types-1.1.0.0, lsp-types-1.0.0.1, lsp-types-1.0.0.0 (has
the same characteristics that caused the previous version to fail: excludes
'base' version 4.15.0.0)
[__3] fail (backjumping, conflict set: base, ghcide, lsp-types)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: base, ghcide, lsp-types,
ghc-api-compat
Try running with --minimize-conflict-set to improve the error message.
