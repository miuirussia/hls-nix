Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: ghcide-1.4.0.3 (user goal)
[__1] next goal: implicit-hie-cradle (dependency of ghcide)
[__1] rejecting: implicit-hie-cradle-0.3.0.3 (conflict: ghcide =>
implicit-hie-cradle>=0.3.0.5 && <0.4)
[__1] skipping: implicit-hie-cradle-0.3.0.2, implicit-hie-cradle-0.3.0.1,
implicit-hie-cradle-0.3.0.0, implicit-hie-cradle-0.2.0.1,
implicit-hie-cradle-0.2.0.0, implicit-hie-cradle-0.1.0.0 (has the same
characteristics that caused the previous version to fail: excluded by
constraint '>=0.3.0.5 && <0.4' from 'ghcide')
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: ghcide, implicit-hie-cradle)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: ghcide, implicit-hie-cradle
