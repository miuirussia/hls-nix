Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: ghcide-1.4.1.0 (user goal)
[__1] next goal: ghc-api-compat (dependency of ghcide)
[__1] rejecting: ghc-api-compat-8.10.6 (conflict: ghcide =>
ghc-api-compat==8.10.7)
[__1] skipping: ghc-api-compat-8.10.5, ghc-api-compat-8.6 (has the same
characteristics that caused the previous version to fail: excluded by
constraint '==8.10.7' from 'ghcide')
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: ghc-api-compat, ghcide)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: ghcide, ghc-api-compat
